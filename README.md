=========
- Simple single page application, for tracking energy bills. 
- No backend, but can be easily extended, and is meant to be used with one.

###Built using
- **JS Libraries:** Angular JS, Angular UI, jQuery, Bootsrtap 3.0
- **Build tools**: Yeoman, grunt-contrib-less, npm

###What it is:
Demonstrates a few angular concepts:
1. Using custom filters
2. Storing values in services and sharing across controllers
3. Typeahead

###Notes
I do have some DOM manipulation in controllers, which breaks convention. 
This is bad practice - only did it for the sake of simplicity. I'll fix linting issues when I get a chance.

Didn't write tests - oops ;)

###Running it:
    npm install
    bower install
    grunt server
