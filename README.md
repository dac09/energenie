=========

Simple single page application with no backend (but can be easily extended to)

###Built using
- **JS Libraries:** Angular JS, Angular UI, jQuery, Bootsrtap 3.0
- **Build tools**: Yeoman, grunt-contrib-less, npm

###What it is:
Demonstrates a few angular concepts:
1. Using custom filters
2. Storing values in services and sharing across controllers
3. Typeahead

**Note:** I do have some dom manipulation in controllers, which breaks convention, didn't have the time to fix this!
